  "FAQmappingSpeedQ":"How quickly can I map my vineyard using Sentinel?",
  "FAQmappingSpeedA":"Using Sentinel‚Äôs highly responsive mapping interface and intelligent automation capabilities, users are able to map entire multi-acre vineyard blocks in under fifteen minutes. As an example, one client with 120 acres was able to map 187,000 vines in 10 days. Once mapped, these sub-centimeter-accurate vine locations serve as a permanent foundation for all future data collection over the entire lifespan of the vineyard.",
  "FAQimportDataQ":"I already have some historical vine-by-vine data. Can I import this into Sentinel?",
  "FAQimportDataA":"We have many clients with historical vine-by-vine data in various kinds of formats. Generally speaking, if the data is both vine-by-vine and structured with some sort of spatial logic, we can carry it into Sentinel. That said, every data set‚Äîand particularly multi-year datasets maintained by multiple generations of users‚Äîhas its quirks, and as such, we like to evaluate imports carefully on a case-by-case basis. The beauty of Sentinel is the near-perfect fidelity with which the dataset is collected, structured, and stored. We prioritize this over everything else.",
  "FAQdataTypesA":"In short, any kind of data you like. Out of the box, our most used vine status families are:\n\n\t- Production Status (Rootstock, Miss, Producing, Non-Producing etc.)\n\t- Irrigation Status (Dry-Farmed, Single Poly, Double Poly, Multiple etc.)\n\t- Disease Status (Red Blotch, Eutypa, Leaf Roll, Trunk Disease etc.)\n\nBut we support fully customization of these status families, as well as the addition of any others. In addition to these statuses, we support numeric data for vine-specific cluster counts, as well as captioned photographs. Everything is stored at each individual vine‚Ä¶for all time.",
  "FAQdataTypesQ":"What types of vine data can I record in Sentinel?",
  "FAQhardwareNeededQ":"Is there hardware required for mapping and in-field data collection?",
  "FAQhardwareNeededA":"Sentinel‚Äôs mobile app integrates cutting-edge geospatial technology in the form of GNSS receivers that clip to the back of your phone and augment your phone‚Äôs geolocation accuracy to the sub-centimeter level. This high accuracy is what allows us to map the very precise location of your vines.\n\nOnce mapped, this permanently stored vine location data allows us to create highly responsive geofencing behavior which enables users to walk up to any previously mapped vine and automatically retrieve a copy of that vine‚Äôs permanent vine record on the screen of their phone within a split-second. These receivers are available from our carefully selected hardware partners via both purchase and rental agreements for very competitive prices. Contact us for more information on these options and we can set you up with an arrangement that best suits your needs.",
  "FAQpricingQ":"What does Sentinel cost?",
  "FAQpricingA":"Sentinel has competitive plans structured for the smallest of small estate vineyards with a few thousand vines to entire vineyard management companies with hundreds of clients. Contact us for more information on how Sentinel can scale to your needs.",
