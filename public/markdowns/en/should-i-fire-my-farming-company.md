# Should I Fire My Farming Company?

If youâ€™re outsourcing vineyard management, it's critical to know exactly how your farming company is performing. But how can you measure that objectively? Sentinel Vine Manager offers precise, vine-level data to audit your farming team's effectiveness accurately and transparently.

## The Problem with Traditional Audits

When evaluating farming performance, most vineyards rely on periodic site visits, verbal reports, and simple yield assessments. While these approaches provide basic insights, they leave out critical operational details:

- **Are unhealthy or infected vines being promptly identified and addressed?**
- **Is pruning being done consistently and effectively across every vine?**
- **Are irrigation decisions made accurately, based on vine health, or just a calendar?**

Without precise data, you're trusting subjective reports. But trust isn't enoughâ€”especially when your vineyard's profitability and longevity are at stake.

## How Sentinel Vine Manager Solves the Audit Problem

Sentinel Vine Manager uses advanced GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) technology and easy-to-use smartphone apps to create a digital twin of your vineyard. Every vine is mapped precisely, capturing its exact location and detailed historical data.

### Benefits of Sentinel for Auditing Farming Companies:

- **Detailed Vine Records**: Instantly verify the state of each vineâ€”track pruning dates, irrigation events, virus tests, and treatments applied.
- **Objective Disease Tracking**: Clearly identify how well your farming company manages critical threats like Red Blotch, Leafroll, or other vineyard diseases.
- **Transparent Accountability**: Sentinel creates an indisputable digital paper trail, clearly highlighting where and when tasks are completedâ€”and when they're not.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you find unexpectedly low yields or increased vine mortality. Traditional audits might rely on explanations from the farming company about "seasonal fluctuations" or "unpredictable conditions." With Sentinel, you can immediately check your records:

- Did the farming company identify infected vines early and remove them?
- Were irrigation schedules adjusted based on vine-level vigor?
- Did pruning occur at the appropriate vine-level precision?

If the answers arenâ€™t satisfactory, you'll have actionable dataâ€”not guessworkâ€”to justify your decision to retain or replace your farming provider.

## Conclusion: Make Confident, Data-Driven Decisions

Your vineyard is an investment. Sentinel Vine Manager helps you protect that investment by giving you clear, objective data on farming performance. Before making significant decisions like retaining or firing your vineyard management company, leverage the precision and transparency provided by Sentinel.
