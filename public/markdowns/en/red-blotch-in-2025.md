# Red Blotch Disease: What Napa Growers Need to Know in 2025 🍇

Grapevine Red Blotch Disease (GRBD) isn't a distant threat—it's already here. With a database of over **5 million vine records** across **five countries**, Sentinel Vine Manager is on the ground from St. Helena to Napa—tracking real-time vineyard health and stepping in whenever things go wrong. And if you're growing grapes in Napa Valley, there's no longer a question of *if* your vineyard will be impacted, but *when* and *how severely*.

## 🚩 The Reality Check: You Probably Already Have Red Blotch

Based on Sentinel Vine Manager's database—tracking millions of vines across California and beyond—there's clear evidence that the disease is widespread and often hidden:

- **Asymptomatic Vines are Everywhere:**  
  Our data shows roughly **20% of infected vines show no visible symptoms**. In other words, for every four vines you identify with classic red leaves, you probably have at least one asymptomatic vine silently spreading the virus.  
  Our global footprint—from California’s AVAs to vineyards in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and France—means we see patterns and spread vectors that others miss.

- **It's Probably Coming from Your Neighbor:**  
  We typically see about half the infections are traceable to neighboring properties—often poorly managed vineyards next door. Without mapping and proactive monitoring, your vineyard is left vulnerable to unmanaged threats beyond your fences.

- **Valley Floor vs. Mountains:**  
  Our data shows Red Blotch prevalence is significantly higher on the valley floor than in mountain appellations. This likely reflects a combination of factors: isolated mountain blocks have fewer neighboring sources of infection, cooler temperatures reduce insect vector activity, and many mountain vineyards are smaller scale with more hands-on management.

## 🌱 Are You Sure Your Budwood is Clean?

One of the biggest sources of Red Blotch infection is contaminated budwood. Whether you're sourcing from external farming companies or propagating in-house, vigilance is non-negotiable.

- **External Farming Companies Must Be Audited:**  
  It's common to see vines marked as misses by farming companies reappear flagged again the following year because they were never properly rogued. Sentinel Vine Manager lets you audit vine removal rigorously and verify that your farming partner is following through.

- **In-House Propagation Needs Mapping and Regular Testing:**  
  If you're collecting budwood internally, it's crucial to precisely map and regularly test your mother vines. Sentinel’s database regularly reveals clear infection patterns tracing back directly to contaminated mother vines—patterns easily preventable with proper vine-level testing and tracking.

## 📍 Start Mapping Immediately (and Excel Isn't Enough)

If you aren't already mapping your vineyard in detail, you're behind the curve. Precise mapping and robust recordkeeping are critical to controlling Red Blotch:  
Our users in five countries rely on Sentinel’s multi-million vine database to benchmark their blocks against regional and global trends.

- **Why Excel or ArcGIS Aren’t Optimal:**  
  Many vineyards currently rely on Excel or ArcGIS. While these tools provide basic recordkeeping, they lack the necessary granularity and actionable insights for effective disease management and proactive decision-making.

- **Why Sentinel Vine Manager?**  
  Sentinel offers precise, vine-level mapping, historical data tracking, and easy-to-use reporting. It’s specifically designed for vineyards, ensuring that you have actionable data—such as vine disease history, roguing status, and clean budwood audits—right at your fingertips.

## 🚀 Migrating to Sentinel is Easy and Essential

Whether you’re in Napa Valley or beyond, our presence in five countries ensures that best practices and lessons learned are baked into every feature.

If you're using Excel, ArcGIS, or similar tools, transitioning to Sentinel Vine Manager is straightforward. With Sentinel, you'll have immediate clarity on:

- Infection rates (including asymptomatic vines) when you test canes
- Rogue status verification (ensuring infected vines are actually removed)
- Clean budwood verification (tracking budwood source health precisely)

Making the switch will save you time, reduce operational risk, and help protect your vineyard’s long-term profitability and health.

## 🎯 The Bottom Line for Napa Growers

Red Blotch is no longer a theoretical problem—it's an immediate, operational risk. Sentinel Vine Manager provides the tools to tackle this risk directly:

- Identify hidden infections early
- Ensure your vineyard management company is accountable
- Keep your budwood propagation clean and disease-free
